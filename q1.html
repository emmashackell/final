        <!-- First form action URL -->
        <h2>http://localhost:3002/send/</h2>
        <p>
            This action URL will <strong>not work</strong> on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting
            service, which means that it does not support running a backend server or processing POST requests.
            The URL `http://localhost:3002/send/` refers to a local server running on your own machine, which
            is only accessible locally. Since GitHub Pages cannot run local servers, this action URL won't
            work when hosted on GitHub Pages.
        </p>

        <!-- Second form action URL -->
        <h2>https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/</h2>
        <p>
            This action URL will <strong>work</strong> on GitHub Pages. The URL `https://dry-bayou-18746.herokuapp.com/send/`
            points to a hosted server on Heroku, which is a cloud-based platform that can handle POST requests
            and process the form submission. Since this is a public, hosted server, GitHub Pages can make the
            request to it, and the form will function as expected.
